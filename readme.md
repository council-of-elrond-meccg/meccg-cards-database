# MeCCG Cards Database

This project has been developed by the Council of Elrond Rules Committee and contains updated information on all cards from the Middle-earth Collectible Card Game (MeCCG).

### [Explore the Database](https://jsoneditoronline.org/#left=url.https%3A//raw.githubusercontent.com/council-of-elrond-meccg/meccg-cards-database/master/cards.json) | [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/council-of-elrond-meccg/meccg-cards-database/master/cards.json)

You can explore the cards on [meccg.com](https://meccg.com/cards) using user-friendly filters and copy card text in various formats to the clipboard.

## Card Updates Compared to the Originals

Most of the card texts remain the same as the original prints, but approximately 300 cards have been updated with the latest text.

* The cards have been standardized with a consistent typographic style.
* CRF errata and clarifications have been applied.
* Card-specific rules from the latest Rules Book have been implemented.
* Challenge Decks texts have been incorporated.
* The texts of cards with multiple versions (from Wizards/The Dragons and Lidless Eye) have been unified.
* Minor changes have been made by the CoE specifically for this database.

You can view detailed changes and explanations for each card by consulting this file:
